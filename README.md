# Nestr Language
## Introduction
Nestr is an experimental language. It is founded upon a simple principle of nesting OOP Classes. Essentially, every class in nested in another class and objects of the child class can only be insantiated inside objects of the parent class. This principle forces every object to have a place where it lives and referencing objects becomes easy because of the hierarchical nature of the objects. 

### Functions
Its functions are simple can only take in and return simple data types such as int, char etc. these datatypes are stored on the stack. However, methods can read and modify objects of its containing class and other objects that visible  to the containing class.
