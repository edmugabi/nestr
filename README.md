# Nest Language
## Introduction
Nest is an experimental language. It is founded upon a simple principle of nesting OOP Classes. Essentially, every class in nested in another class and objects of the child class can only be insantiated inside objects of the parent class. In this principle it forces every object to have a place where it lives. 

### Functions
Its functions are simple can only take in and return simple data types such as int char. etc. However it can also modify objects outside its method definition but which are in its visible scope.
